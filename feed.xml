            <title>Network-based firewalls and why suck ass</title>
            <description>My school has network-wide site blocks, yet they barely use them (since they have goguardian for the students). Examples include all of neocities, certain youtube downloaders, and other presets defined by Cisco and Comcast Business.
            &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
            But it is extremely easy to bypass these filters (since they are applied on the network). Just don't use Comcast's DNS (75.75.75.75, 75.75.76.76), and set up the world's simplest proxy.</description>

            <title>Has trump caused a pre-order drought in the US?</title>
            <description>Nintendo delayed switch 2 pre-orders in the US due to the tariffs, and Framework has recently done the same thing for a similar reason (keep in mind, pre-orders for both were to open on the same day). If this means pre-orders for both open up on my birthday that's fine, but idk about everything else.</description>
