            <title>Has trump caused a pre-order drought in the US?</title>
            <description>Nintendo delayed switch 2 pre-orders in the US due to the tariffs, and Framework has recently done the same thing for a similar reason (keep in mind, pre-orders for both were to open on the same day). If this means pre-orders for both open up on my birthday that's fine, but idk about everything else.</description>
